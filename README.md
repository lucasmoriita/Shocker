<H1>Shocker</H1>
The intention of this project is to make a DualShock a fully customizable input source on Linux.<br>
The user will provide something like a .config or a yaml mapping all the buttons and its relative key.<br>
In the end of this project the user will be able to not only customize all keys but to use it
full time, and wont have to worry about game support.
